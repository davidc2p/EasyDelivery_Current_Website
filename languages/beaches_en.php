The Portuguese coast extends the distance of 1793 km. Among the islands, Azores and Madeira, and  mainland, the diversity of beaches is enormous. Although large extent, the Portuguese coast presents a linear configuration with few clippings. The appearance of the shoreline depends mainly on the characteristics of the rock formations that are in contact with the sea and the intensity of sea erosion. 
<br/><br/>   
On the coast dominates a coastline of high cliffs. The coast beach, low and sandy, occupies a smaller length of the coastline on the mainland and on the islands, which explains the volcanic cliffs of the coast. 
<br/><br/>   
In the north, while the coast is carved in rocks of great hardness, the contact line  with the sea presents itself predominantly low due to the existence of a narrow strip of coast of emergence - the coastal area that has emerged due to receding water sea - giving small recesses and some beaches. 
<br/><br/>   
On the contrary, where the sea contacts softer rocks, such as sandstones and clays, the coastline appears at a lower coast beach, and you can find recesses conducive to deposition of sand. This is what happens in coastal areas between Espinho and S.Pedro de Moel and Eastern Algarve, for example. 
<br/><br/>    
In the archipelagos of Madeira and the Açores, dominates the coastline of high cliffs, sometimes more than a hundred meters, especially in the northern part of the islands. The coast beach is rare, emphasizing some more extensive beaches on the island of São Miguel, in the Azores, and the southern coast of the island of Porto Santo, Madeira.

The Portuguese coast  corresponds with and increasing quality, safety and cleanliness and the jury assign values to this designation. 
<br/><br/>  
With this recognition, Portugal is to become one of the most iconic coastal destinations worldwide. Proof of this is also the recognition received by the Travel Agents Association ITTA, which recognized the Algarve as the best destination for sun, awards that took place in January 2011 in a grand ceremony of European tourism sector in Dublin.
