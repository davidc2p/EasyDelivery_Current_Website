If you land one day at Lisbon airport, you may be lucky enough to take the airfield from the south. The plane then describes a semicircle from the north, flies over the Atlantic Ocean, the Tagus estuary, all shimmering in the glow of the morning light or sunset, and then, when it begins its descent, you will see the city of Lisbon from a quick but unique perspective. The airport is located inside the city. We wish this journey to be slower, to have time to enjoy everything.";

Lisbon is the seven hills city. It is bathed throughout the year by a pleasant light, dazzling summer, mild in winter. It is never very cold. The city has retained the former quietness and still manages to live slowly paced, just like old times. The ancient districts have kept their authenticity, their shops, their Fado bars, the restaurants and wineries, their sounds and odors. In winter there can the characteristic smell of roasted chestnuts while walking the streets. It is absolutely necessary to wander in Alfama and Graça, two neighborhoods of old Lisbon submersed in an atmosphere of nostalgia. Two labyrinths with cobbled narrow streets, where you can easily lose your way.";

Saint Jorge Castle offers a magnificent view of the city, an ideal place for lovers of history, photography and will also delight the most discerning palates. Must walk to the castle from Rossio or Martim Moniz, and you will enjoy the narrow streets and souvenir shops nearby. Further west, old monuments await you. The Torre de Belém, architectural gems of the XVI century, contemplates the Tagus and contrasts with whiteness. Close, the Jeronimos Monastery (mosteiro dos Jerónimos) also offers the testimony of the abundant wealth at the time of discovery and houses the naval and archeology museums.";

Lisbon is not only a city of history, it is also a modern city with new districts, like Oriente, specially renovated for the Universal Exhibition of 1998. Large gardens extend northward out of sight beyond the large bridge Vasco da Gama. In Oriente, everything is done to remind the undulating waves of the ocean. The hotel Myriad recently installed in the Vasco da Gama Tower, the tallest tower in Lisbon, offering stunning views of the Tagus River and the eastern part of the city.

If you want to shop, supply is abundant. You can walk in the neighborhoods of traditional trade, starting in place of Marquis of Pombal (Marquês de Pombal) and down the Avenida da Liberdade, or for a more traditional trade still down Almirante Reis Avenue and then walked towards Rossio and Praça da Figueira. If you're tempted by a more modern commerce, a visit to the malls of the capital is then required. Among the temples of consumption, you will find the Colombo shopping mall or shopping center Vasco da Gama, notable for its architecture reminding a ship.
